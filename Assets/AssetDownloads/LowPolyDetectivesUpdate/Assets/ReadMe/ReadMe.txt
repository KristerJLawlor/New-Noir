Thank you for acquiring the Low Poly Detectives package! 
This package was originally released in 2018. The current updated version is a gathering of small changes and tweaks made over the years based on requests. The female character is entirely new. 
To alternate head styles, activate/deactivate the 'Head' meshes within the characters hierarchy.If you encounter any issues with this package, please contact support.
